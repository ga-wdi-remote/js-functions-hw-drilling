# Homework : Function Drilling

<!-- MATERIALS METADATA -->
<!--
  title: 'Function Drilling'
  type: homework
  creators: Matt Brendzel
  competencies: javascript, functions, problem solving
-->

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-r2d2` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

Next, navigate to the directory for today, go into the `homework` directory, and
run `npm install` -- this will download any assignment-specific JavaScript
dependencies into to a directory called `node_modules`.

As you work through this assignment, you should make commits regularly.
In particular, since there are automated tests built into this assignment, we
recommend that you make a commit every time that you pass a new test, in
addition to any other time you feel might be appropriate (e.g. just before
trying out something new).

## Instructions

Read through `hw.js` and complete all of the functions listed there.

### Testing Your Work

A set of automated tests, written in the [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/)
testing framework, has been provided for you with this assignment.
To run these tests, type `npm test` into the console from the root directory
of this repo. Test your work regularly, and read the feedback from the tests
carefully -- it may give you a clue about what to do next.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your work, push the code to your fork on GitHub.
Then, create an issue on the `wdi-remote-...` repo using the same convention
as before: "YourGitHubUsername -- Week XX Day XX". Run the test suite one last
time, take screenshot of the output, and paste that screenshot into the issue's
body. Also include a link that points back to the code on your fork, and a
'comfort' score for your understanding of the material.
